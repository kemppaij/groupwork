# Group work - Team 2 
1) Configured Github for the team.
- Create and cloned repo 
- Tested creating separate branches and pull request to make sure things were working on everyone's machine.

- Downloaded and shared perm key (because we didn't want to use Azure SDK due to it being slow)
- Made sure that everyone could connect to the VIM from their computers.
3) Create directory structure for the assignment (in visual studio code)
- To make sure that we all had the same structure and configs (DB connection) before starting to work in individual branches.
